# Clustering Analysis and Deep Learning Regression Prediction of on Housing Prices

## Phase 1: Clustering Analysis

### Business Problem:

A house flipping company would like to identify underpriced homes by comparing asking prices to predicted sale prices.   They would like to segment homes into groups to analyze what kinds of homes there are. They would also like a model that predicts the selling price of a home.

The company has provided publicly available data from the King County Assessor's office to use for clustering and prediction.

**Data notes:**

BrickStone is the percentage of a house that is made of brick or stone.


### Objectives

The house flipping company would like you to segment the homes sold in the database and create an analytical report on the clusters describing each cluster and describing how they are different. The data has had some cleaning work to it, but you should verify that it is ready for clustering.

### Action:
>- Filtered out all duplicates
>- Fixed all Inconsistencies in data
>- Checked for null values
>- Checked for Significant outliers
>- Used Kmeans to cluster data into 5 groups based on the values gotten from the Silhoutte Score


### Results:



## Phase 2: Deep Learning Regression
